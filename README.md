# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Lasso-Regression
This notebook explores and predicts heart disease using the Heart Disease UCI dataset. The dataset contains 76 attributes, and the "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease. 
It also dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them.
